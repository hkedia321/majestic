           MCC is the exclusive dealer for 22PLE in the U.A.E. 22PLE is the latest technology in paint protection systems that goes above and beyond any past car wax, paint sealant, or paint coating. 22PLE Signature Glass Coating is a high silica-based paint coating that can be applied to clearcoat and non clear coated automobile paint to protect the paint from the harmful elements.
         </p>
         <p class="text-justify">
           The high silica-content glass coatings are applied in a thin layer as a liquid, and once cured, 22PLE literally leaves a hardened glass barrier between the paint (or other protected areas) and the harmful elements  industrial and environmental pollutants such as UV, acid rain etc. So not only does this glass barrier provide a brilliant gloss and shine, it offers a level of protection to your car that can’t be equaled by any wax or sealant. While most carnauba waxes last only for a few months and sealants upwards of 4-6 months, you can expect 24-36 months durability with 22PLE Glass Coating!
         </p>
         <p class="text-justify">
           22PLE has developed an ultra-durable glass-based sealant with formulations for paintwork, metal and plastic. Their Signature Glass Coats are easy to work with, set as hard as glass and offer a tough barrier against the elements along with extreme shine.
         </p>
         <p class="text-justify">
           22PLE products contain an extremely high percentage of silica and do not rely on elevated levels of alcohol as a curing agent. As a result 22PLE Glass Coats provide a truly scratch resistant coating and all products are extremely easy to apply. Expect deep, rich reflections after applying this product. And, your paint will literally be smooth like glass. Why, because it’s made from glass! So, whether you’re a professional detailer or a keen enthusiast, 22PLE is the perfect choice.
         </p>
         <p class="text-justify">
           After the first application of protection, 22PLE needs 3-5 hours to cure. After this initial cure time, it will take 5 days for 22PLE to fully cure to its maximum hardness. You can wash your car with traditional soap and water, just keep in mind that between the 5th hour and 5th day, the product is still curing so you don’t want to expose the paint to anything extreme during that time.
         </p>
         <p class="text-justify">
           One of the key features of this coating is that harmful and destructive contaminants won’t stick to the surface as easily…leaving your paint in much better condition for a longer period. And since there’s less “stick” on the surface, you’ll find that washing and drying is MUCH easier and quicker. Your wash mitt will glide across the surface like never before (creating a safer, mar-free wash process), and drying is near effort-less due to the hydrophobic properties of 22PLE.
         </p>
         <p class="text-justify">
           When used on wheels and metal, the VM1 formula will prevent heavy brake dust buildup, and make subsequent cleanings much easier. And when used on plastic trim, the VR1 formula will create a deep, rich color that will last for well over a year…as opposed to just weeks for other trim products!
           The product that gives you the longest lasting paint protection is not a wax or a sealant…its 22PLE Glass Coating. When you are looking for paint protection systems for your car, contact MCC and set-up an appointment to get your car the paint protection it deserves so it stays looking like new! It’s perfect for new car detailing or for easy used car maintenance.
